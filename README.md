# PQR Mart Customer Data 


# Retail Sales Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the mart store management gain deeper insights into their sales performance and customer behavior. It provides a clear view of which sub-categories contribute the most to sales, how profit trends change over the years and quarters, and which shipment modes are most frequently used. By analyzing the sales and profit across different regions and locations, the store can identify high-performing areas and focus on regions that require strategic improvements.

The dashboard also highlights the return status of orders, helping the store monitor product returns and understand potential issues behind them. With interactive filters like the order date slicer and a detailed view of customer names with their corresponding sales amounts, the management can identify loyal or high-value customers and create targeted marketing or loyalty strategies.

Moreover, key performance indicators like total sales, profit, quantity sold, and the number of orders are presented clearly to track overall business health. By using this dashboard, the store can make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction, optimize inventory, and boost overall profitability.
